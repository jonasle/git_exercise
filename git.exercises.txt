Exercises used in the Git course of Tass Belgium.

1. Fork the repository https://github.com/jonasle/git_exercise on GitHub

2. Clone the forked repository on your machine

3. Edit your .gitignore so that those pesky .out files from the source code in src/ are not tracked. Try to build and check "git status" to verify it works

4. Create a branch called 'WIP' from commit <> and switch to that branch. In 'WIP' add your name here: #YOUR NAME#

5. Merge your branch WIP back into the master branch and solve the merge conflict that happens

6. Move the LICENSE file to lic/LICENSE and make sure this move is tracked in Git

7. Use your Git skills to tell me what was on this line (and add the tool you used here: #GIT COMMAND#)
